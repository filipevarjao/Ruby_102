h3. Objective

Extend the currency-conversion example from lecture so that you can write 5.dollars.in(:euros) 10.euros.in(:rupees) etc.
You should support the currencies 'dollars', 'euros', 'rupees' , 'yen' where the conversions are: rupees to dollars, multiply by 0.019; yen to dollars, multiply by 0.013; euro to dollars, multiply by 1.292.
Both the singular and plural forms of each currency should be acceptable, e.g.  1.dollar.in(:rupees) and 10.rupees.in(:euro) should work.  You can use the code shown in lecture as a starting point if you wish; it is at http://pastebin.com/agjb5qBF
